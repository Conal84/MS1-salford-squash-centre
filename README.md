## UX
___
### User Stories
As a potential new customer I want to access squash centre information realting to
a first time visit to the centre. This includes centre location, parking, court and changing room facilities,
and how to become a member and / or book a court.

As an existing member I want to be able to access squash centre timetable, training session
and court booking information easily so I can effortlessly use the court facilities.

### Strategy
The Salford Squash Centre website will serve the business objectives
by attracting new customers to the centre and by supporting the needs of
existing customers. Overall this will increase the squash centre sales.

Website users will have easy access to squash centre information and booking
systems which will allow them to use the centres facilities in an
effortless and smooth way.

This website will be aimed at a range of squash player demographics from
junior amateur players aged 12 to 18, senior amateur players 18 to 50 to 
elite competitive players at both junior and senior age ranges. As a result
of this wide range of users the site must be simple to use and laid out in 
a concise manner.

### Scope
Website key features will include the following;

* About Section - provides general squash centre information
    * Court information
    * Facilities information
    * Parking
    * Membership
    * Fees

The site will also have a section with quotations from the squash centre
coaches which aims to provide a link between the coaches and potential
new customers. These quotations also give potential new customers a sense
of the professionalism of the squash centre.

### Structure
I want to keep the site as minimalist and clutter free as possible so that it is
easy to use for the wide ranging demographic. Users should be able to sign up easily as such I will adhere to the 3 click rule of thumb.
Information will be provided to users in a concise, straight forward manner. A common navbar and footer
will be used throughout the design.

Information will be grouped in 3 key areas;
* About - providing general squash centre infromation to the user
* Play - providing specific squash playing information
* Sign Up / In - a page where users can enter their details
